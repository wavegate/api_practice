# API Practice

View demo: https://famous-palmier-72762f.netlify.app/

The goal of this project is to practice asynchronous JavaScript using the pokemon API.

This demo uses three different notations to obtain lists of Pokemon from the PokeAPI: AJAX, Promise, and await/async and presents how long it took for the request to occur.

Concepts practiced:

- API GET requests with fetch API and AJAX XMLHttpRequest with error handling
- Self-invoking async functions
- Cache prevention by adding a random token to the request
- Use of regexp to check if a string links to an image (not very effective since only checks if something is an image by name)
- Scroll into view on added element
- Navbar padding offset with JavaScript
- Variable number of parameters and use of 'arguments'
- Using Date to track how long a process takes
